# Next steps

* Detect when we reached destination
* Remove NavMeshAgent
    * It attaches Camera to NavMesh and limits camera movement to NavMesh only
* Dynamically import spatial mesh and build NavMesh
* Use WorldAnchors to dynamically reconstruct position and location of previously scanned spatial mesh
